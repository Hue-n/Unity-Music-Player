## Welcome to my Unity Music Player! (A prototype)

### Project Description
This Unity Music was created as an exercise for Object-Oriented Programming and utilizes Unity ver. 2020.1.17f1! <br />
The original was created by YouTube user: xOctoManx on Aug 19, 2017. <br />
His tutorial is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpiwhC8zp4A <br />

I built on what he taught in his tutorial by adding dynamic song titles and album covers.
